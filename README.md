This is a breif overview and introduction to the most commonly used file formats during processing of NGS sequecing data. In general, most files are text files with some specific structure and usually specified by a suffix. For example a .fa file is a file in FASTA format with some structure text content.

The aim of this workshop is to provide users with a quick and easy introduction to the commonly encountered file "formats" so they are able to easily recognize what approaches they would need to take as they analyze their data.
